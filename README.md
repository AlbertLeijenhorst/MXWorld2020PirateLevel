Here you can download the Level X module for making your own level in our Mendix World 2020 Pirate app. 

Before you start it is best to create new project in Mendix 8.10.0 in which you choose a native profile. Maybe it is even best to follow the steps of this learning path: 
https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/path/66/Build-a-Native-Mobile-Inspection-App
And import the module in that project.

The level you build preferably consists of just 1 page and the entity provided is the page parameter. 
On that page you can do whatever you want, as long as it will work on your mobile phone as a nice game/puzzle. 
The level should have a clear ending, such that we can link up the success flow. 

Submit your level by downloading the mpk file here, edit it, and 
sending it to: A.Leijenhorst@magnus.nl or d.vdham@magnus.nl . 

Good luck and have fun!
